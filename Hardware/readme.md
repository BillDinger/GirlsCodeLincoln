# Overview

This semester we're going to use [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to do the following projects this semester.

* A Retro gaming computer.
* A music streaming service.

## Lecture 1 - A brief history of the Raspberry PI

## Lesson 1 - Unpack your Raspberry Pi & Setup

1.  Unpack your Raspberry PI. You will have (4) components. From left to right in the picture the case,
the Raspberry Pi itself with a heatsink, the power supply & the setup guide.

2. Carefully peel back the blue plastic from the heatsinks. Apply the sticky side down to the two processors (The black chips) on the raspberry pi.

3.  Watch [the video](https://www.canakit.com/pi-case) for installing the Raspberry Pi into the case.

4. Get a SD card from the teacher and plug it into the SD card slot on the Raspberry PI.

6. Talk to the teacher to get a monitor so we can get the IP address of your Raspberry PI.

7. Open up your laptop, and open Putty. Fill in the IP Address from step 6 and click `open`

8. Login to the machine with the following credentials:
```
username: pi
password: raspberry
```

9. At the command line type in `sudo raspi-config`

10. Select `change user password and hit enter when prompted.

11. type in `girlsrule` in password and confirm password and then `ok` when the success box come sup.

12. Use the arrow keys to select `interfacing options` and press `enter`

13. Select `vnc` and press `enter` and select `yes`. When prompted type in `y`.

14. Once it has finished use the arrow keys to select `finish`.

15. At the command prompt type `sudo apt-get update`

16. at the command prompt type `sudo apt-get install lightdm` and then type in `y` when prompted.

17. Once it has finished installing type in `sudo rapsi-config`.

18. Once it has finished installing, select `boot options`.

19. Select `Desktop/CLI` and then `desktop autologin`.

20. Go back to the main screen and select `<finish>` when prompted to reboot select `<no>`

21. Type in `sudo apt-get install lxsession` when prompted type in `y`

22. Once it has finished type in `sudo shutdown -r now` 

23. On your laptop find the program called `vnc viewer` - it'll be under a folder called `real vnc` in the start menu.

22. Enter the IP address from step 6.

24. A box will come up with a warning, select continue.

25. If prompted enter the username/password below and select `remember password`.
```
username: pi
password: girlsrule
```

26. Congratulations! You are now logged into your Raspberry PI!

## Lecture 2 - What is apt-get? What's Raspbian?

## Lesson 2 - Obligatory Minecraft Installation

1. If you havent already, log into your Raspberry PI using RealVNC as detailed in steps 23-25 in Lesson 1.

2. Select the application button at the far bottom left then system tools -> lxterminal

3. Type in `sudo apt-get update` and then enter.

4. Type in `sudo apt-get -y install minecraft-pi`.

5. Go to the applications icon at the far left then games -> minecraft

7. We need to update some video settings. At the bottom right hand corner of the screen select the `vnc` icon

8. Select the hamburger menu at the top right and then options

10. Ta-Da! Minecraft. Go ahead and click `start game`

## Lesson 3 - Lets make a basic temperature monitor

Note: Adapted from [this project on raspberrypi.org](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/temperature-log)

1. If you haven't already log into your raspberry pi as in steps 23-25 in Lesson 1.

2. Select the application button at the far bottom left then system tools -> lxterminal
![loonix terminal picture](https://i.imgur.com/2oNqpHz.png)

3. Type in `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get -y install raspberrypi-ui-mods` and press enter.

4. This will take some time as we upgrade the Raspberry Pi to the full desktop version. A box will come up telling you about desktop options changing, go ahead and select `ok`.

5. type in `sudo shutdown -r now` and press enter.

6. When the computer comes up from shutdown click on the terminal icon at the top left.

7. type in `sudo apt-get -y install rp-prefapps`

8. Click on the Raspberry logo at the top left then preferences recommended software.

9. Select Programming and then `Mu` and click OK
![mu selected](https://i.imgur.com/E9f65F0.png)

10. Open a terminal window and type in `sudo apt-get -y install python3-matplotlib` and press enter.

11. type in `sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip` and press enter

12. type in `pip3 install gpiozero` and press enter

13. type in `pip3 install rpi.gpio` and press enter

14. Once it has finished installing go to the raspberry icon -> programming -> mu

15. Select Python3 as the default mode.

16. You can use the GPIO Zero module to find the CPU temperature. First youâ€™ll need to import the CPUTemperature class:
```
from gpiozero import CPUTemperature
```

17. Then you can create a cpu object:
```
cpu = CPUTemperature()
```
18. Click `save` and call the file `temp`.
19. Click `run`
20.  At the prompt that comes up type in `cpu.temperature`. This is the CPU's tempature in celsius. Do a quick google search of the tempature to see what it is in Fahrenheit.
